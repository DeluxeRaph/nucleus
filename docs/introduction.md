# Introduction

**Nucleus** is a privacy-first, modular AI engine for building customizable developer tooling. It provides the core infrastructure for integrating local/self-hosted LLM capabilities into any development environment without sending data to external services.

## What is Nucleus?

Nucleus is **not** an end-user application - it's a foundation for building AI-powered developer tools with deep customization through a plugin/tool system.

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy & Security First** - All processing happens locally or on self-hosted infrastructure
2. **Modular Architecture** - Components can be composed and extended independently
3. **Plugin-Driven** - Tools and plugins customize AI behavior per-project needs
4. **API Stability** - Building toward a stable API for downstream integrations
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Core engine separate from UI/interface layers

## Project Status

⚠️ **Active Development**: nucleus is currently being rewritten from Go to Rust. The architecture and core concepts remain stable, but internal APIs are evolving.
